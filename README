The program manual_pipes.cpp uses ring buffers in shared memory to implement an
experimental pipeline-style for C++ accross multiple forks. The manual_pipes.cpp
program provides a concrete representation upon which macros and operator
overloading for operator| and operator% will be written and will eventually look
something like:

    List<float> xs, ys;
    xs | map(float, x, x + 1) | gpu_map(pt, c, c = pt * 10) > ys;

which will populate ys with the results of xs over the transforms given in map()
and gpu_map().
